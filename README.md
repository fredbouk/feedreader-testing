# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application ([Feed Reader starter code](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader)) that reads RSS feeds.  

The project contained an incomplete test suite written in the JavaScript testing framework Jasmine with only one test.

My task was to analyze the HTML, CSS and JavaScript and learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against the application and finish the incomplete test suite.

## How to run the project

- Clone or download the project from: `https://github.com/fredbouk/feedreader-testing.git`

- Open index.html in a browser of your choice.
